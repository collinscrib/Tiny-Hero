Upon death in this voxel-style platformer, you're rewarded with a certain amount of coins depending on how far you got in a level. Use your coins to buy upgrades and different colors for your hero in the shop, and try to make it to the end to save the princess! 

The game consists of three levels, Grassy Plains, Fire Mountain and the Evil Castle. Good luck!

Controls: WASD for movement, Space Bar to jump, and Escape for the menu.
